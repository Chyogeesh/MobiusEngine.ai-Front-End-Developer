## Final Notes

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready landing page that you can customize to match the exact Figma design provided by MobiusEngine.ai. The code is organized, well-documented, and follows modern React best practices.

To exactly match the Figma design, you would need to:
1. Replace the color variables with the exact colors from the design
2. Adjust spacing and typography to match
3. Replace placeholder content with actual copy
4. Add any specific animations or interactions shown in the design

Would you like me to modify any specific part of this implementation to better match what you're looking for?
